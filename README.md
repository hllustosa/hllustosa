# Hello, this is Hermano ðŸ‘‹

Despite the name suggesting otherwise, I am Brazilian, currently residing in the beautiful [TeresÃ³polis/RJ](https://www.google.com/search?q=teres%C3%B3polis). I have been working in software development in both industry and academia since 2011.

I am passionate about foundational software that does the heavy lifting so that user applications can shine. Need some proof?
